  * Revolutionise the future delivery of research by accelerating the use of real-time data-processing and machine learning, computer simulation and data analytics for big science projects and facilities.
  * Transform the competitiveness of UK industry by accelerating the development and adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.
* Solutions for 21st century challenges
  * Build on our key strengths and collaborate with partners to develop challenge-led solutions that address both the UK’s industrial strategy priorities and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.
  * Capitalise on the new streams of funding available from government to help UK industry gain competitive advantage in developing markets by accelerating innovative technological solutions.
* Developing advanced technologies
  * Increase our world-leading capability in key technologies where the underpinning technical skills and expertise have been established within our national laboratories.
  * Work with our community to develop an inventive and strategic programme that leads the world in adopting, adapting, developing and exploiting the detectors and instrumentation, accelerators, specialist engineering and optics required by our world-leading research programme.
  * Seize the opportunity to lead novel technology and engineering projects that support our broader science goals.
  * **Support UK leadership of advanced technologies and their translation into marketable products, working with partners in UK Research and Innovation, other government departments and industry**
* Research and innovation campuses
  * Catalyse the development of economically productive clusters of leading businesses that exploit our multidisciplinary research strengths, facilities and technology capabilities.
  * Attract the investment needed to sustain the success of the research and innovation campuses, unlocking their regional and national economic potential.
  * Continue to develop our research and innovation campuses as key assets to support the delivery of UK Research and Innovation’s Strategy and the industrial strategy.
* Inspiring and involving
  * Inspire all sectors of society to value and participate in scientific discovery through the awe and wonder of our frontier science, engineering and technology.
  * Enhance public awareness of the economic, international and wider public benefits of investment in science and technology, using STFC’s science as an exemplar.
  * Target hard-to-reach groups to increase the diversity of the future UK science and engineering community.  
  * Encourage the next generation to study and work in science and technology.

## Strategic Enablers
* **Fostering collaboration**
  * **Build productive collaborations, based on complementary strengths and expertise, to deliver our programme and contribute to innovation and growth.**
  * Develop new strategic approaches to sustaining the research infrastructure critical to UK research, whether located in the UK or overseas.
  * **Maximise the opportunities, enabled by the creation of UK Research and Innovation, to build stronger interdisciplinary research and innovation partnerships.**
  * **Build mutually beneficial relationships with the industrial research community to exploit the UK research base and enhance productivity.**
* Working together with our community
  * Provide high-quality strategic leadership, using our convening power to co-design solutions and responses to scientific and industrial challenges, policy questions and initiatives.
  * Harness the expertise of the wider research community in deciding where to invest our resources.
  * Develop capability and wellbeing in our community by removing barriers to diversity wherever we find them, and by supporting everyone to perform at their best.
  * Communicate openly and honestly, ensuring our staff and wider community are fully engaged in everything we do.
* Creating an outstanding organisation
  * Work in partnership to deliver a safe, productive and resilient environment for UK Research and Innovation that is also a great place to work.
  * Strengthen the management of our strategic approach to programme planning and investment.
  * Create the essential cultural backdrop and underpinning processes to drive and support strategic change.

# Key Prirotites
* Work effectively as part of UK Research and Innovation to develop an improved research and innovation system in the UK that is greater than the sum of its parts.
* On behalf of UK Research and Innovation, lead the development of a coherent national roadmap for leading-edge research infrastructure and e-infrastructure, complementing European and global initiatives, and maximising opportu- nities for the UK to lead and host international infrastructures.
* Work with our community, Government and other international funders to make the case for and develop the single and multidisciplinary facilities and experiments needed to keep UK science at the leading edge.
* Ensure that the impact of new and developing facilities, such as the SKA, are fully realised by co-ordinating the UK’s collective interests in their science, industrial opportunities, public engagement and technology challenges.
* Define and support a scientific programme to discover the secrets of the Universe, investing in the highest-priority projects in particle physics, astronomy and nuclear physics and the enabling technology, accelerator and computing programmes needed to further enhance the UK’s world-leading status in these fields.
* Keep the multidisciplinary facilities accessed by UK researchers across the full spectrum of science at the leading edge to deliver against the UK’s industrial strategy and advance the understanding of interdisciplinary domains.
* Increase the UK’s global impact by growing the number of international science and technology projects with substantial UK involvement.
* Develop and maintain a strategy for each of our five technology areas to focus our efforts, build synergies and guide investment.
* Work with our partners in UK Research and Innovation, government and industry to accelerate our portfolio of extraordinary, potentially disruptive technologies emerging from large science projects and ensure these capabilities are exploitable by UK industry.
* Develop and deliver a prioritised plan to tackle 21st century challenges using our facilities, technology and skills to address both the UK’s industrial strategy priorities and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.
* Develop and implement strategic plans for our Sci-Tech Daresbury and Harwell Campuses, key assets for UK Research and Innovation, with the ambition to deliver a step change in investment, high-value job creation and economic growth.
* Expand our doctoral training programme to provide the skills needed to manage, analyse and interpret increasingly complex datasets, supporting approaches across UK Research and Innovation to drive future economic growth.
* Further develop our approaches to the recruitment, retention and training of our workforce to ensure we have the technical skills required to operate, maintain and upgrade our facilities for the future.
* Fully implement our Public Engagement Strategy to showcase our remarkable and awe-inspiring science so that people value and pursue careers in science, technology and engineering.
* Increase the diversity and inclusion of both our workforce and the communities we fund.
