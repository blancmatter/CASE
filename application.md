# Application Sections - Characters

## 1.2 Proposed Project Details (3000)

This section enables the CASE Panel to assess the scientific merit of the project; please write clearly with sufficient detail.

Give references to STFC’s strategic priorities and explain how the project is aligned to STFC’s core programme.

Provide a detailed description of the milestones, methodology, experimental approaches, study designs and techniques to be used. Highlight plans which are particularly original or unique.

It is the nature of research that the outcomes of a project cannot be predicted. It is important that the key technical and other risks to the successful delivery of the project are identified in the proposal, and contingency plans are in place to ensure the project has successful outcomes. Therefore identify the extent to which the project is innovative both commercially and technically. Highlight and explain the timeliness and novelty of the project. Describe any evidence you have to substantiate your belief that the intended project is innovative.

Identify key risks and uncertainties of the project and provide a risk analysis for the project content and approach. Explain how the project would mitigate these key risks and alternative approaches that may be used in contingency. Give details of the arrangements that are in place for managing risks (both technical and environmental).


## 1.3 Impact Summary (1500)
Give details of the economic, social and environmental benefits that the project is expected to deliver. List any beneficiaries from the research, for example those who will benefit from the proposed research- directly or indirectly. It may be useful to think of beneficiaries as ‘users’ of the research outputs.

Beneficiaries must consist of a wider group than that of the investigator’s immediate professional circle carrying out similar research.

Economic – Highlight benefits to users, suppliers, the broader industrial markets and the UK economy. The application should identify and quantify where possible the benefit to each of the beneficiaries.

Social – Quantify any expected social impacts, either positive or negative, on, for example, the quality of life, social inclusion/exclusion, education, public empowerment, health and safety, regulation, diversity and any expected impact on Government priorities.

Environmental – If applicable, demonstrate how the project will benefit the natural environment.

## 2  ACADEMIC RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT, TRAINING AND SUPPORT (1500)  
Give details of the academic training and research environment, and explain how this will benefit both the student and the project. Clearly state the duration of the proposed project and explain why this duration is the most appropriate for the project. Provide a clear project plan of how the project will be managed, including how the student’s time will be split between the academic RO and the non-academic partner research training environment and how these fit in with the aspects of the project. Give details of how the training and research environment will enrich the student’s experience.

You may wish to include:

* integration with existing students;

* interactions with other researchers and staff;

* opportunities to participate in interdisciplinary team work;

* current infrastructure, expertise, facilities and technologies available in the department/group and the organisation;

* a timeline showing how the student’s time will be split between the academic RO and the non-academic partner.

Research training
Give details of how you will address the project-specific and generic training needs of the student, highlighting how this addresses strategic skills gaps (where relevant) and how the project will be managed so that the work at the academic RO can derive greatest benefit from the placement for the student.

You may wish to include:

* appropriate practical and technical research training;

* specific training courses and seminars;

* arrangements to support interdisciplinary research training;

* internal arrangements for planning, managing and monitoring its provision of postgraduate research training (including the procedures in place for student representation on relevant departmental committees and opportunities for student feedback on the training environment);

* computing;

* statistical techniques;

* health and safety;

* business and finance related training;

* transferable skills and employability

## 3  NON-ACADEMIC RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT, TRAINING AND SUPPORT (1500)  
Give details of the non-academic training and research environment and explain how this will benefit the student and the project. Clearly state what facilities will be available and how the project will relate to them.

You may wish to include:

* Integration with existing students, if applicable;

* interactions with other researchers and staff, such as technicians, health and safety, lab scientists, senior scientists, IP and legal reps, sales, managers, directors, CEO, CSO;

* opportunities to participate in interdisciplinary teamwork;

* current infrastructure, expertise, facilities and technologies available in the organization.

Give details of how you will address the project-specific and generic training needs of the student, highlighting how this addresses strategic skills gaps (where relevant) and how the project will be managed so that the work while at the non-academic partner will be carried out with greatest benefit to the student.

You may wish to include:

* appropriate practical and technical research training

* specific training courses and seminars

* arrangements to support interdisciplinary research training

* internal arrangements for planning, managing and monitoring its provision of postgraduate research training

* computing

* statistical techniques

* health and safety

* presentation and communication skills

* team-working

* time-management

* business related training

* finance related training

* Intellectual property related training


## 4 Management and monitoring (2000)
Clearly show the roles that the academic department and the collaborating organisation will play to ensure high quality supervision of the student and the proper monitoring of student progress throughout the duration of the award.

Provide details of how you will monitor the student and their training needs during the course of the studentship, including:

* Supervision arrangements, assessment arrangements, frequency of supervisor/student contact and the involvement of staff other than the principal academic supervisor in the supervisory process (if appropriate);

* How you will manage the partnership with the industrial company to ensure high quality supervision of the student and the proper monitoring of student progress;

* Opportunity for students to provide feedback.

## 5 The collaboration (4000)
Explain how the collaboration will provide the student with a challenging research training experience, within a context of a mutually beneficial research collaboration between the student, academic and non-academic/industry partner. Explain how the project will be managed in order to maximise the benefit to all parties in terms of student training and scientific output.

* Provide the unique qualities of the collaboration. How will the collaboration benefit the proposed project? Can the project be done without the collaboration?

* How will the collaboration benefit the training experience of the student?

* How will the collaboration benefit both the academic and non-academic partner?

* Give details of what IPR arrangements are in place.

* Provide details of specific training that will only be carried out when the student is on placement at the non-academic partner which could not be carried out at the academic partner .e.g. Health & Safety, marketing & sales, production.

* Give comprehensive and technical details of the anticipated work the student will complete while at the non-academic partner – refer to timelines if appropriate.

* Give details of any commercial agreements in place
